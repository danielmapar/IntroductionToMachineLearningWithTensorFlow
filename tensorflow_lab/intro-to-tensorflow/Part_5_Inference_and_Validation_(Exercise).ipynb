    "# Inference and Validation\n",

    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** set. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training."

There are various ways in which we can use the `.subsplit()` method. Here we are going to sub-split the data by providing the percentage of data we want in each set. To do this we just pass a list with percentages we want in each set. For example,\n",

A word of **caution**, TensorFlow Datasets does not guarantee the reproducibility of the sub-split operations. That means, that two different users working on the same version of a dataset and using the same sub-split operations could end-up with two different sets of examples. Also, if a user regenerates the data, the sub-splits may no longer be the same.

If we take a look at the plots we can see that at the beginning of training the validation loss starts decreasing, then after some epochs it levels off, and then it just starts increasing. Therefore, we can stop training our model when the validation loss levels off, such that our network is accurate but it's not overfitting.\n",

    "Another common method to reduce overfitting is called **dropout**, where we randomly drop neurons in our model during training. This forces the network to share information between weights, increasing its ability to generalize to new data. We can implement dropout in `tf.keras` by adding `tf.keras.layers.Dropout()` layers to our models. \n",

    "randomly sets a fraction `rate` of the dropout layer's input units to 0 at each update during training. The `rate` argument is a float between 0 and 1, that determines the fraction of neurons from the previous layer that should be turned off. For example,  `rate =0.5` will drop 50\\% of the neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that we should never apply dropout to the input layer of our network. Also, remember that during training we want to use dropout to prevent overfitting, but during inference we want to use all the neurons in the network. `tf.keras` is designed to care of this automatically, so it uses the dropout layers during training, but automatically ignores them during inference."
